A modification of the NASM assembler to support generation of instructions that are compliant with Google's Native Client (NaCl)'s rules.
 - This can be built with the commands
	 ./configure
	 make
 - The nasm binary is produced in the same folder

To build assembly in a NACL compliant way, invoke NASM as you would normally, along with the additional flag '-nacl'
	nasm -nacl jquantf-sse2.asm -o .libs/jquantf-sse2.o

Note that the support for NACL is incomplete. The following NACL rules are supported
- Generated instructions should not straddle 32 byte boundaries
- Function blocks should be aligned to 32 bytes
- Call instructions should be at the end of a 32 byte block
- All ret instructions are replaced with 'pop, mask and jump' pattern

Not yet supported
- NaCl pseudo instructions such as nacljmp - this is not needed though - use a normal ret and the assembler will do the right thing
- Conversion of indirect jumps via a register - these should be masked and replaced. This is not yet supported
- 64 bit NaCl support - i.e. the load and store base + offset pattern
- Detecting the use of any NaCl blacklisted instructions

To ensure that your compiled code does not use any features from the "Not yet supported" section, run the NaCl verifier after you build your binary with NASM
	ncval_new lib_yourlib.so

For the most any code that compiles without the '-nacl' flag should compile without any changes when you give the '-nacl' flag. 
However, keep in mind, 
- Jump targets may now become out of reach causing a compiler error. For example a 'jump short' instruction target may no longer be within range and so this would cause an error when nasm is invoked on your code

              NASM, the Netwide Assembler.

Many many developers all over the net respect NASM for what it is
- a widespread (thus netwide), portable (thus netwide!), very
flexible and mature assembler tool with support for many output
formats (thus netwide!!).

Now we have good news for you: NASM is licensed under the "simplified"
(2-clause) BSD license.  This means its development is open to even
wider society of programmers wishing to improve their lovely
assembler.

The NASM project is now situated at SourceForge.net, the most
popular Open Source development site on the Internet.
